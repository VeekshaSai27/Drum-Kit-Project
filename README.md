# Drum-Kit-Project

This project is a Drum Kit Web App that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on on-screen buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

Tech Stack Used:

HTML (index.html)
Defines buttons labeled w, a, s, d, j, k, and l which simulate different drum sounds.
Includes a title and a footer.

CSS (styles.css)
Handles the visual styling.
Provides animations, button designs, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (index.js)
Adds interactivity.
Detects key presses or mouse clicks.
Plays appropriate drum sound using audio files.

About the Project:
When a user clicks a button or presses a key (w, a, s, d, j, k, or l), a specific drum sound is played.

DOM Manipulation:
I learned how to interact with elements on a webpage using JavaScript — like selecting buttons, changing their appearance, and responding to user actions.

Event Handling:
I understood how to capture user inputs through mouse clicks and keyboard key presses. I used addEventListener to make the drum kit respond when the user interacted with it.

Sound Integration:
I explored how to add sound to a website by using the Audio object in JavaScript. I linked different sounds to different buttons and keys, making the webpage interactive.

Frontend Tech Stack Practice:
I got hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together — learning how they work together to build a complete, interactive webpage.
